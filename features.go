// exists on the Parse and Negotiate functions.

	// The XML name of the feature in the <stream:feature/> list. If a start
	// element with this name is seen while the connection is reading the features

	// If the stream feature is a legacy feature like resource binding that uses
	// an IQ for negotiation, this should be the name of the IQ payload.
	Name xml.Name

	// Bits that are required before this feature is advertised. For instance, if
	// this feature should only be advertised after the user is authenticated we
	// might set this to "Authn" or if it should be advertised only after the
	// feature is authenticated and encrypted we might set this to "Authn|Secure".
	Necessary SessionState

	// Bits that must be off for this feature to be advertised. For instance, if
	// this feature should only be advertised before the connection is
	// authenticated (eg. if the feature performs authentication itself), we might
	// set this to "Authn".
	Prohibited SessionState

	// Used to send the feature in a features list for server connections. The
	// start element will have a name that matches the features name and should be
	// used as the outermost tag in the stream (but also may be ignored).

	// Used to parse the feature that begins with the given xml start element
	// (which should have a Name that matches this stream feature's Name).
	// Returns whether or not the feature is required, and any data that will be
	// needed if the feature is selected for negotiation (eg. the list of
	// mechanisms if the feature was SASL authentication).
	Parse func(ctx context.Context, d *xml.Decoder, start *xml.StartElement) (req bool, data interface{}, err error)

	// A function that will take over the session temporarily while negotiating
	// the feature. The "mask" SessionState represents the state bits that should
	// be flipped after negotiation of the feature is complete. For instance, if
	// this feature creates a security layer (such as TLS) and performs
	// authentication, mask would be set to Authn|Secure, but if it does not
	// authenticate the connection it would just return Secure. If negotiate
	// returns a new io.ReadWriter (probably wrapping the old session.Conn()) the
	// stream will be restarted automatically after Negotiate returns using the
	// new ReadWriter. If this is an initiated connection and the features List
	// call returned a value, that value is passed to the data parameter when
	// Negotiate is called. For instance, in the case of compression this data
	// parameter might be the list of supported algorithms as a slice of strings
