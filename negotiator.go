// Negotiator is a function that can be passed to NewSession to perform custom
// session negotiation.
// This can be used for creating custom stream initialization logic that does
// not use XMPP feature negotiation such as the connection mechanism described
// in XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol.
//
// If a Negotiator is passed into NewSession it will be called repeatedly until
// a mask is returned with the Ready bit set.
// When the negotiator reads the new stream start element it should unmarshal
// the correct values into "in" and set the correct values in "out" for the
// input and output stream respectively.
// Each time Negotiator is called any bits set in the state mask that it returns
// will be set on the session state, and any cache value that is returned will
// be passed back in during the next iteration.
// If a new io.ReadWriter is returned, it is set as the session's underlying
// io.ReadWriter and the internal session state (encoders, decoders, etc.) will
// be reset.

// NewNegotiator creates a Negotiator that uses a collection of StreamFeatures
// to negotiate an XMPP client-to-server (c2s) or server-to-server (s2s)
// session.
// If StartTLS is one of the supported stream features, the Negotiator attempts
// to negotiate it whether the server advertises support or not.
//
// The cfg function will be called every time a new stream is started so that
// the user may look up required stream features, the default language, and
// other properties based on information about an incoming stream such as the
// location and origin JID.
// Individual features still control whether or not they are listed at any
// given time, so all possible features should be returned on each step and
// new features only added to the list when we learn that they are possible
// eg. because the origin or location JID is set and we can look up that users
// configuration in the database.
// For example, you would not return StartTLS the first time this feature is
// called then return Auth once you see that the secure bit is set on the
// session state because the stream features themselves would handle this for
// you.
// Instead you would always return StartTLS and Auth, but you might only add
// the "password reset" feature once you see that the origin JID is one that
// has a backup email in the database.
// The previous config is passed in at each step so that it can be re-used or
// modified (however, this is not required).
