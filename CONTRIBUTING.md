# Contributing

Bugs and feature requests can be started by opening an [issue][issues].

If you want to contribute a patch or pull request, make sure you do the
following first:

  - Format all code with `go fmt`
  - Write documentation comments for any new public identifiers
  - Write tests for your code
  - Follow Go best practices

If you're not sure where to begin, grab any of the issues labeled
[`starter`][starter], and if you need help with any of this, don't be afraid to
ask!

To add your signature, add a line like the following to the end of your commit
message with your name and email:

You can add this line easily using Git by committing with `git commit -s`.
If you forget to add a signature to a commit, quickly add it to the latest
commit with `git commit --amend -s --no-edit`.
