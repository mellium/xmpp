// Compression with LZW.
//
// Be advised: stream compression has many of the same security considerations
// as TLS compression (see RFC3749 ยง6) and may be difficult to implement safely
// without special expertise.
//
// Deprecated: the stream compression implemented in this package is no longer
// recommended by the XSF and will be removed in a future version of this
// library.
